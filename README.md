# Digital Image Processing in MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB project that demonstrates various digital image processing techniques through an interactive GUI created using MATLAB's GUIDE tool. The project provides functionality for image manipulation, color channel adjustments, thresholding, and histogram operations.

## Features

The application enables users to perform the following operations:

### 1. **Image Manipulation**
   - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of images.
   - Supports operations between images or with constant values.

### 2. **Color Channel Adjustments**
   - Modify individual RGB channels to create color effects such as:
     - Reddish or bluish tones.
     - Isolate specific channels for analysis.

### 3. **Thresholding**
   - Perform single or double thresholding for segmentation tasks.
   - Adjust thresholds dynamically via the GUI.

### 4. **Histogram Operations**
   - Compute and display histograms for grayscale and RGB images.
   - Perform histogram equalization to enhance image contrast.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB R2018b or later (GUIDE compatibility).
- Basic understanding of digital image processing concepts.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NASO7Y/digital-image-processing-matlab.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the GUI file (`project.m` or `.fig`) in MATLAB.
4. Run the project:
   ```matlab
   project
   ```

## Usage
- Load an image using the GUI.
- Use the provided buttons and menus to:
  - Manipulate the image.
  - Adjust color channels.
  - Apply thresholding.
  - View and modify histograms.

The GUI is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible for beginners and advanced users.

## Project Structure
- `project.m`: Main script file containing the callback functions for GUI operations.
- `.fig` files: GUI layout and design.
- Supporting files: Additional scripts for specific image processing tasks.
- `Gui_interface` : photo to show what the interface looks like
